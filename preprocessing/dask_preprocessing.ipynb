    "1. Change No Positive, No Negative fields into \"\"\n",
    "2. Remove empty reviews from the dataset \n",
    "3. change the capitalization of all words to lower \n",
    "4. If the given score is above 7.5 assign positive sentiment \n",
    "5. If the given score is below 4.0 assign negative sentiment \n",
    "6. Only keep the reviews which either have a negative or a positive review\n",
    "7. Combine the positive and negative reviews in a new column called review \n",
    "8. keep only the review field with text and the sentiment \n",

    "#### Word Embedding \n",
    "1. Remove words which aren't words with regex\n",
    "2. tokenize all of the words using word_tokenize from nltk\n",
    "3. Make sure that all of the words are in english using a library not sure which yet\n",
    "4. remove the reviews of which the words are not all in english or empty\n",
    "5. embed all of the words using Word Embedding, also add padding to make sure that all of the sentences have the same amount of vectors \n",
